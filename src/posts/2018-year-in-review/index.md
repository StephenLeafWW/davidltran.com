Well, that passed by in a blink. Let's go over some highlights during the past year and set some goals for this year.

Let's start off with some numbers!

## Stats

- [316 GitHub contributions](https://github.com/davidlamt?tab=overview&from=2018-12-01&to=2018-12-31)
- [38 blog posts](/archives)
- Read (listened to) 10 books
- Listened to 32 hours of podcast episodes (since the last [post](/blog/podcasts-to-listen-to-in-2018/))

## Highlights

In April, I was given a [new opportunity](/blog/a-new-chapter) to advance in my career. I am constantly amazed that I have the opportunity to work with such passionate teams to help improve the lives of others.

My new company also helped me attend my [first conference](https://jamstackconf.com/). Being surrounded by others who are passionate about their work reenergized me and learning about new techniques made me excited to just go out and build things.

I hope to attend more conferences in the future where I can hopefully muster up the courage to talk to more attendees and vendors.

I also participated in my first [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) and have a t-shirt to prove it! This was also my first time contributing to open source projects. My first dive into the open source community was met with positivity and encouragement.

I would like to continue helping others as many of my own projects have been built on open source software. Furthermore, I believe that I can become a better developer by understanding and working with various different systems.

In the last quarter of 2018, I started to really focus on my health. I started tracking what I ate and that helped me adjust my meals to help me achieve my goals. I also began meditating and started exercising again.

## Goals

I have not written a blog post in the past few months. Once I decide to not write for a week, it becomes exponentially easier to not write the next week. And the following week...

This year, I hope to write more consistently to keep the momentum going. Let's say at least biweekly!

Also within the same time frame, I began watching more television and using social media. I hope to replace some of that time with another activity that is more beneficial.

While I am still [mostly free from the grips of social media](/blog/year-without-social-media), I have noticed that I am opening them unnecessarily various times during the day. Hopefully I can reduce or even eliminate this bad habit.

I plan on developing more mental toughness through meditation and thought-provoking podcasts. On the physical side, I plan to continue weight lifting to increase my stamina, improve flexibility, and strengthen my muscles.

I understand that improving my mental and physical health will aid in every aspect of my life. Ultimately, I cannot become a better person if I do not take care of my mind and body.

## Final Thoughts

A part of me feels that I am not doing this year in review justice. I am certain that I have forgotten about other important events. This is why I am starting to keep track of special moments in 2019.

Not only will this make this year's review easier, it will help me reflect on the crucial moments of life.
