I used the following regular expression to test for US phone numbers.

Note that it may not cover all cases; I will display some of the cases I was testing for below. Feel free to use the expression at as a starting point and make modifications to meet your requirements.

## Solution

```re
/^\+?1?[-. ]?\(?([2-9][0-9]{2})\)?[-. ]?([0-9]{3})[-. ]?([0-9]{4})$/ 
```

These are some variations that are matched by the regular expression:

```
4141234567 
414.123.4567 
414-123-4567 
414 123 4567
(414) 123-4567 
1 (414) 123.4567 
+1 414 123 4567
```

You can use a site like [this](https://regex101.com/) to verify the matches. Make sure to update the regex options to use the "global" and "multi line" flags.

## Closing Thoughts

While regular expressions are usually language-independent, I did use it in JavaScript. I utilized the [RegExp.test()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/test) method to determine if there was a match between the regualr expression and a string.
