Migrating the blog [again](/blog/migrating-from-wordpress-to-hugo)??

Yup.

This is the third time my blog has drastically changed in the past year. Am I constantly unhappy with the work I put into my blog?

Well, not exactly. However, nothing would change same if I was happy, right? I believe that there has to be *some* discontent when things change.

I consider my site a playground for experimenting with new technologies and methodologies. I love to learn new frameworks and techniques but I always have trouble applying them to projects.

Even if I am (somewhat) content with the current state of my blog, I can envision all the awesome features I can implement with my newfound knowledge. **This site, itself, serves as an outlet for my creativity**.

I must say that working with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) has been a real joy and I can foresee myself staying with this static site generator for years to come. Though, we'll just have to see whether I hold onto that belief!


## Gatsby

I discussed why I decided to move from a dynamic CMS like WordPress to a static site generator in a [previous post](/blog/migrating-from-wordpress-to-hugo).

I will just list the main points in a TL;DR manner:

- Simplicity
- Security
- Maintenance
- Speed

I was drawn to Gatsby specifically because it utilizes React. I have had some experience using React but I wanted to improve my knowledge of it. Furthermore, I have been hearing a lot about [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) [lately](/blog/podcasts-to-listen-to-in-2018). In Gatsby, data is pulled in using GraphQL.

Rebuilding my site with Gatsby would be a great introduction to these technologies that I was already set on learning.

### Development

It would be remiss of me not to mention Scott Tolinski's awesome [Pro Gatsby course](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/pro-gatsby). This course taught me nearly everything I needed to build the site you see.

Scott's course also introduced me to [styled components](https://www.styled-components.com/). I have some many good things to say about this method of writing CSS (maybe I haven't used it long enough to see the downsides). But, I will withhold my thoughts for future posts!

From what I can tell, the development process of Gatsby sites is as smooth as Hugo's process.

I have to give a standing ovation to the GraphiQL editor integration with Gatsby. This editor made testing GraphQL queries very easy and significantly reduced my development time.

Again, I had to transfer my content Gatsby. However, this process was not so painful since my content were already written in Markdown. I just had to update the meta data (written in YAML) and fix some linking issues within the content.

Out of all three iterations of my site, I have to say that this iteration was the most hands-on. I used prebuilt themes for the other versions while not having a deep understanding of how the cogs turned.

Not to say that I now have deep knowledge of React, GraphQL, and Gatsby. However, I do feel like I have a good understanding of the internals of my site and would feel comfortable modifying it in the future.

### Theme

The look and feel are currently experiencing is **largely** inspired by Sean Wash's [personal site](https://seanwash.com/). I really liked how simple and intuitive his site was and wanted to convey something similar with mine.

Again, I would like to credit my design to [Sean Wash](https://seanwash.com/). Check him out for great design and development ideas and thoughts!

Somehow, each iteration of my site is more simple than the last. My tastes are constantly changing but I feel as if they are converging towards simplicity. I like how clean and accessible this project turned out!

### Dynamic Content

If you had been around before this migration, you will have noticed that the email subscription box and comments section has vanished.

I love the connection that comes with dicussing a particular interesting blog post (which is all my posts). This is why I previously used Disqus to faciliate comments.

I may or may not have removed the comments section because I wanted my blog to look as clean as possible. Also, I believe that these discussions can also take place on a more well suited platform (like [Twitter](https://twitter.com/davidlamt)).

As for the email subscription form, I had used MailChimp since I was serving a static site with no back-end.

To be honest, I had only one subscriber to my email list. It was my girlfriend. üôÇ

Anyhow, Netlify now offers [form handling](https://www.netlify.com/docs/form-handling/) if I do want that feature in the future.

## Netlify

Oh man, how I wish I would have discovered [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) sooner.

This service made setting up automatic deployment and HTTPs so easy. I "configured" (clicked a button) Netlify to automatically rebuild and deploy my site when changes are pushed to the master branch on my site's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/davidlamt/davidtranscend-com-gatsby).

Long gone are my days of setting up webhooks to automatically pull in changes and rebuild my site.

There is also a one-click option for adding free HTTPS support to your site. You heard that right: *FREE* TLS certificates with Let's Encrypt that are automtically renewed. I also used Let's Encrypt on my previous site but I had to set up a Cron job to keep the certificates updated.

Netlify also deploys your site to a global CDN that allows your users to access your sites more quickly.

I forgot to mention that I am hosting my site **for free**. Yup, I am receiving all the aforementioned features for free. This is because Netlify has a ridicuously awesome free tier.

You can also easily add content to your site using [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/). This provides a user-friendly "back-end" to modify your site's data. I will continue writing content in Markdown because I find it enjoyable but I may implement this in the future.

## Closing Thoughts

Hope you enjoyed reading my non-sponsored post praising Gatsby and Netlify. Gatsby and Netlify, please sponsor me. üôÅ

Overall, I had a fantastic time recreating my site with these new, great technologies. I now have a better understanding of these tools and I hope to continue using them in future projects!

There is one feature I miss from Hugo and WordPress: scheduling posts. I have not been able to find a way to schedule posts to publish in the future with Gatsby and / or Netlify. If you have any ideas, please reach out!

What are your thoughts on Gatsby and Netlify? In your opinion, what are some downsides of static site generators that I have failed to mention?
